# Remove-Background-Python-API-Key
Remove Background Python Using api Key

Import Libraries: The code begins by importing the necessary libraries:

requests: A library for making HTTP requests to the remove.bg API.
shutil: A utility module for high-level file operations.
Define Function remove_background_with_api:

This function takes the remove.bg API key (api_key), the path to the input image (input_image_path), and the path where the output image with the background removed will be saved (output_image_path).
It constructs the URL of the remove.bg API endpoint.
Sets the headers for the HTTP request, including the API key.
Prepares the image data to be sent in the request body.
Sends an HTTP POST request to the remove.bg API endpoint with the image data.
If the response status code is 200 (OK), it saves the resulting image with the background removed to the specified output image path using shutil.copyfileobj.
If the response status code is not 200, it prints an error message along with the status code and response text.
Set remove.bg API Key and Input/Output Paths:

The remove.bg API key (api_key) is set to the provided key.
The input image path (input_image_path) is set to the path of the image from which the background will be removed.
The output image path (output_image_path) is set to the path where the resulting image with the background removed will be saved.
Call the Function to Remove Background:

The remove_background_with_api function is called with the provided remove.bg API key, input image path, and output image path to remove the background from the input image using the remove.bg API.
Output and Error Handling:

If the background removal is successful, a message indicating success is printed.
If there is an error during the background removal process, an error message along with the status code and response text is printed.
